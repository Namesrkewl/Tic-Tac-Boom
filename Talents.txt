Talents:

DISPLAY CD OF ALL YOUR ABILITIES GLOBALLY, PUT IN A MENU SHOWING OTHER PLAYER'S SKILL CDS AS WELL
WHEN A MATCH STARTS, CREATE A LOAD SCREEN SHOWING BOTH PLAYER'S LOADOUTS
	
Make only 1 bomb usable per turn
Players start with small bomb, 1 turn default cd
every bomb used goes on cd for an extra turn after
usage
add skip turn button if no move possible

bombs-
1. X Bomb to destroy things in an X; 3 turn default cd
2. + Bomb to destroy things in a +; 3 turn default cd
3. Big Bomb to destroy things in a 3x3 radius, destroys walls in 1 hit; 5 turn default cd

passives- 
1. 1 Extra Move per 2 turns
2. Extra Small Bomb Charge
3. The first time an opponent is about to win,
destroy the symbol they placed and regain an extra
small bomb- need last placed variable for last move

skills rated by difficulty to implement - 
1. Place a mine that blows up spaces when someone goes
on it- DONE, NEEDS SPRITE (JUST CHANGE BASED ON TAG, MIGHT WANT TO REFACTOR PLAYER THIS WAY AS WELL)
2. Push a symbol in 1 direction to an open space- select piece then select directional arrow, medium
3. Shift an entire row, column, or diagonal
(good idea for a stage, think conveyer belts)- same as push, but for row/column/diag, medium
4. Teleport a symbol to a place of your choosing- select piece then tile, easy
5. Erect a wall up to 3 tiles long
must be destroyed with 2 bombs- select start point, then tap up to 2 more tiles and confirm, medium
6. Place 3 moves in a sequence- same as wall, medium
7. Cover an entire border row/column; you can no longer
win on borders this round- same as conveyer, but check for pieces, medium
9. Expand the board (up to 7) and get an extra turn- select row then column, redraw grid with same
piece indices, medium
10. Shrink the board (down to 1) and skip your turn- same as expand but select exising row & column
and remove those indices, medium
11. Rotate a 2x2 space of symbols cw or ccw- store next position to a temp variable, move over the
current position; do this 4 times based on rotation, easy

passives requiring a locked bomb/skill-
1. Reduce the max cd of X bombs by 1
2. Reduce the max cd of + bombs by 1
3. Reduce Big Bomb cd by 1
4. X Bombs replace spaces, +2 max cooldown
5. + Bombs replace spaces, +2 max cooldown
6. X Bomb reach increased by 1
7. Y Bomb reach increased by 1
